## How it Works:

The goal of the game is to hit **20 clams** before your opponent does.

At the end of each round, you gain **1 clam** by having one of your Pokemon hold **1 of 5 control points**. 

At the start of a turn, you are given **5 energy**, which you can spend either on your *shop* or the *board*.  Your turn ends when you run out of energy. Each round consists of each player taking a turn. 

### Shop: 

The shop randomly gives you 3-6 things! There are 2 types: **Pokemon** and **Items**. 

The shop tier upgrades every **two rounds**, going up to 6. The higher your shop tier, the stronger the Pokemon and Items available become.

Buying anything from the shop costs 2 energy (unless stated otherwise). Rerolling your shop costs 1 energy.

### Pokemon: 

You can purchase a wide variety of Pokemon in your shop.
Pokemon have HP, attack, speed, and range stats.
- HP represents your pokemon health
- Attack represents the damage dealt upon using a normal attack
- Speed represents the number of spaces you can move in a single turn
- Range represents the number of spaces your attacks can target in a radius around you (*ex. 1 range is a 3x3 area, 2 range is 5x5*)
  
Energy Costs:
- Moving a Pokemon costs 1 energy
- Regular attacks cost 1 energy
- Special attacks have differing costs, equivalent to the amount specified in the attack description.
- Passive abilities do not have a cost and happen automatically.

Many Pokemon can evolve into a higher-tiered Pokemon. This can be done using a Rare-candy item, or by purchasing the evolution in the shop. Evolution fully heals the user.

### Items:

Two types: Held Items and Fed Items
- Held Items are given to a Pokemon and are not consumed (until later in some cases). They can be replaced at any time.
- Fed Items are given to a Pokemon, consumed immediately, and are single-use.
